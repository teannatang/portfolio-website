    <h1>PlutoPay</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <p>PlutoPay is a mobile virtual wallet app used to help make transactions easy and more efficient. The app is designed for tech-savvy
      individuals who want a quicker way to shop or complete transactions and a way to help practice better spending habits.</p>

      <b>My Role:</b> UX/UI Design, User Research, and User Testing
      <br>
      <b>Duration:</b> Aug 2021 – Feb 2022

    <div class="row">
      <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Before going into the design of an app, it is important to first identify the problem in order to create actual solutions. 
            Therefore, I did an extensive amount of research in order to have a good understanding of wireless payments so that users
            feel safe enough to give PlutoPay their private information.</p>

    <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>The targeted users for PlutoPayare busy, tech-savvy individuals who are already familiar with other virtual methods of 
      payment or shopping. These 2 user personas, Jada and Maria, were created to show common issues of what the target
      audience for PlutoPay would possibly experience.</p>

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>The development for the "Pay User" user flow  will be displayed. The low and mid-fidelity prototypes were created prior to conducting user testing and making changes on the user flow. 
        The user flow in the high-fidelity prototype includes the changes made after user testing.</p>
      
      <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        <p>The low-fidelity prototypes for PlutoPay were created with pen and paper.</p>
          <div class="prototypes">
              <picture class="prototypes"><img src="img/plutopay/wireframes/low-fidelity/pay-user-low1.jpg" alt="pay-user-low1"></picture>

          </div>
        
      <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        <p>An interactive midfidelity prototype was created with Balsamiq using the same layout and flow as the low-fidelity prototype.</p>
          <div class="prototypes">
            <picture class="prototypes"><img src="img/plutopay/wireframes/mid-fidelity/pay-user-mid1.png" alt="payusermid1"></picture>

  <div class="row">
    <h2>Findings</h2>
      <p>Most of the assigned tasks during user testing were completed successfully by all participants. However, I discovered three issues that would be concerning to the success of the app if they were 
          left unfixed. Therefore, I came up with solutions for these two issues and made the necessary changes on the final prototype. The 3 issues and their corresponding solutions are shown below.</p>
          <br>
          <b>Issue #1: Users were unable to identify all the main functions of the app after interacting with the app.</b>
          
          <p class="improvement">Improvement: Add onboarding that introduces all main features of the app.</p>
          
          <b>Issue #2: Users struggled to complete the task "Add a New Payment Method and would need assistance.</b>
          
          <p class="improvement">Improvement: Rename "Wallet" to "My Wallet" in order to make this option more clear.</p>
          
          <b>Issue #3: Users were unable to interpret the shopping icon successfully.</b>
          <p class="improvement">Improvement: Change current shopping icon to a shopping cart because it is more common.</p>
  </div> 


  <div class="row">
    <h2>Prototype</h2>
      <p>Many changes were made and additional testing was conducted prior to creating the high-fidelity prototype for PlutoPay. I conducted preference testing to determine a finalized UI theme as well 
        as made changes to the original user flows where participants struggled to complete during user testing. Through all the trial and error, I quickly realized the importance of conducting these tests 
        because having other perspectives help me find issues that I would not be able to find myself.</p>
