    <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <p>The objective of this project was to create a virtual portfolio website to showcase my UX/UI skills that
        I've obtained throughout my year with CareerFoundry. This portfolio is important because it will
        be the main source that employers will go to in order to find more information about me and my
        work. By using what I learned in my Frontend Development course, I used a combination of HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript to create my portfolio website. </p>
      <b>My Role:</b> UX/UI Design and Developer
      <br>
      <b>Duration:</b> Feb 2022 – May 2022

      <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
      <h3>Background:</h3> 
        <p>The final product of my frontend development
            course was a personal portfolio website that showcased my
            UX/UI design skills as well as my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            skills. This project was completed over the course of 4 months.</p>
      <h3>The Problem:</h3> 
        <p>The reasoning behind choosing the frontend route
            was to have another skill for my resume to be more appealing to
            potential employers. Having no background in computer
            science, it was extremely challenging. But with a lot of practice
            and help from my peers and mentor, I now have a better
            understanding of the development process and will be able to
            apply my knowledge in the workforce to communicate more
            efficiently with developers.</p>
      <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>To design and code a responsive portfolio site that showcases my UX/UI
                projects and coding capabilities.</li>
              <li>Write error free code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h2>Process & Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Researched various successful portfolio websites and used them as inspiration</li>
          <li>Created a style and layout that represents me the most accurately and that I resonate with the most</li>
          <li>Organized images and drafted text for each section</li>
          <li>Incorporated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into VSCode</li>
          <li>Designed using a mobile-first approach and then moved to other common display sizes including desktop and tablet</li>
          <li>Collected data from user testing and made changes based on feedback</li>
          <li>Conducted cross-browser testing</li>
          <li>Downloaded linters to ensure there were no errors in my code</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h2>Foundation</h2>
      <p>I first created a rough sitemap. I decided what I wanted to add for each of my pages on my portfolio by
        drafting the textual content, compiling all of the images together into a folder, and finalized style choices such
        as colors or fonts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Homepage:</b> Intro, Project Descriptions, SVG Animations</li>
          <li><b>About Page:</b> Headshot, About Section, Skills & Tools</li>
          <li><b>Project Pages:</b> Detailed Case Studies</li>
          <li><b>Contact:</b> LinkedIn, Behance, Email</li>
        </ul>
      <p>After compiling everything I wanted into my website, I began creating a preliminary version of my website.
        The layout of my website was created with HTML and stylistic elements were added afterwards with CSS.
        Eventually, JavaScript was incorporated to add elements that enhanced the experiment for other display sizes such
        as a hamburger menu for smaller displays.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>The final product of this project was a responsive portfolio site that I can use to showcase my skills to
        potential employers. I would say I'm pretty proud of what I was able to
        accomplish in this short amount of time with no knowledge or background in computer science! Prior
        to this course, I never would have thought I would be able to code my own website from scratch. Even
        though my portfolio looks very simple, I have definitely come a long way from when I first started attempting
        to code.</p>

      <p>I plan to add more elements in the near-future to
        make my portfolio look more unique. I am excited for
        my UX/UI journey as well as my frontend development
        journey and I am even more excited to see my growth
        throughout my journey! :)</p>
